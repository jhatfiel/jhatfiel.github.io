<h1>ChatGPT Experiments</h1>
<h2>Problems</h2>
  Times when ChatGPT failed to some degree
  <h3>Current limiting resistor for LED</h3>
  A high-school level understanding of electronics is necessary for this one.  
  But ChatGPT was <a href='https://chatgpt.com/share/d1a643a0-83c2-4f9b-9755-09242dfbc8d0'>very confident</a>, 
  and then later changed its stance after being pressed.
  
  <h3>Find a comic</h3>
  Straight-up <a href='https://chatgpt.com/share/917e9f9f-a44c-4f12-8dde-982bb5820dfc'>fabrication of non-existent artwork by a legitimate artist</a>.<br>
  Here's the image I was looking for:<br>

  <h3>Fitting functions to data</h3>
  This one is really long and involved.  Lots of great information was presented.  
  It was just disappointing that such a foundational mistake was made. 
  Since I don't fully understand the curve fitting concepts, 
  it took a little bit of troubleshooting before I could narrow down what exactly the problem was.
  Focus, specifically on <a href='https://chatgpt.com/share/6ec36050-e16e-4217-920c-b775a6a05cc0'>one of the first polynomialFit functions which had the order of a,b,c reversed.</a>

  <h3>any[] vs number[] in typescript</h3>
  I can almost excuse this one as <a href='https://chatgpt.com/share/d03edfdc-211d-47c3-b749-5a44fdcadd9c'>I pushed it</a>
  to come up with an "inline type" solution.  But it should have pointed out that I would lose some strict typing benefits.

  <h3>Sardinas-Patterson algorithm failure</h3>
  This was rather involved and I basically was just trying to 
  <a href='https://chatgpt.com/share/ea5edef9-d1a3-436f-a1b1-abb963640746'>determine the shortest string</a> 
  required to prove a prefix code mapping was non-unique.  
  Again, we have the problem of confidence in error.  So many, many errors...<br>

<h2>Success</h2>
  It's only fair that I should include some success stories as well.
  <h3>Texas Hold'em hand strength</h3>
  Casual games with extended family and there were some <a href='https://chatgpt.com/share/e7ee6257-3b4c-41f4-8fdd-e09005765454'>interesting situations</a> 
  that I was unsure about.  ChatGPT gave me a very clear breakdown of the rules in both situations.

  <h3>Bell-shaped / peak functions</h3>
  I'm almost embarrassed by <a href='https://chatgpt.com/share/4a43f168-8253-4f2d-8149-7abe2598f4f1'>this one</a>, 
  as I should have known to look at the normal distribution instead of speaking in such arbitrary terms, 
  but that makes this almost even more impressive. 
  It gave me the normal distribution nicely defined with parameters that directly control the characteristics of the curve.  
  But <i>additionally</i>, it gave me 3 other possible curves that were similar for me to explore

<h2>Just For Fun</h2>

        <p class="story-description">Straight-up fabrication of non-existent artwork by a legitimate artist.  John Holcroft is a freelance illustrator who sometimes crafts comics that are political in nature.  However, he did not create a comic named "The Two Cities".  The <a href='https://64.media.tumblr.com/864c839058d5319d8b1333e613cac53c/tumblr_nkdjhspeoX1rwkrdbo1_1280.jpg'>specific comic I was looking for</a> is by <a href='https://www.tomgauld.com/'>Tom Gauld</a>.</p>

        <p class="story-description">This one is really long and involved.  Lots of great information was presented.  It was just disappointing that such a basic mistake was made. 
  Since I don't fully understand the curve fitting concepts, it took a little bit of troubleshooting before I could narrow down what exactly the problem was.</p>

        <p class="story-description">This was rather complicated and I basically was just trying to determine the shortest string required to prove a prefix code mapping was non-unique.  
  Again, we have the problem of confidence in error.  So many, many errors...</p>

        <p class="story-description">Casual games with extended family and there were some interesting situations that I was unsure about.  ChatGPT gave me a very clear breakdown of the rules in both situations.</p>

        <p class="story-description">I'm almost embarrassed by this one, as I should have known to look at the normal distribution instead of speaking in such arbitrary terms, but that makes this almost even more impressive. 
  It gave me the normal distribution nicely defined with parameters that directly control the characteristics of the curve. But <i>additionally</i>, it gave me 3 other possible curves that were similar for me to explore.</p>

        <p class="story-description">Prompted by a misspelling of a word on a corporate posting (they had left out an E) I thought it would be funny to have a "DZI" department that ensured the equitable treatment of all letters.
  I thought ChatGPT delivered nicely on this prompt and gave me a good mission statement and motivating paragraph.</p>
